# SysInsight - Quick Demo Guide

## 🎯 For Your Presentation

### 1. Start Everything (Already Running!)
```bash
cd "/Users/karandhillon/Linux Project/SysInsight"
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Open Dashboard
```bash
open http://localhost:5001
```
Or manually navigate to: **http://localhost:5001**

### 3. Wait 30-60 Seconds
Let the graphs build up some history to show the fluctuations.

### 4. Key Points to Mention

#### The Problem We Solved
- "Initially, graphs showed flat lines because the Docker container was idle"
- "Added a workload simulator to create realistic system activity"
- "Now graphs show dynamic, real-world patterns"

#### What You're Showing
- **Real-time monitoring**: Updates every 5 seconds automatically
- **CPU fluctuations**: 7-10% varying load from background workers
- **Memory patterns**: Gradual allocation and deallocation cycles
- **Disk I/O**: Continuous file operations showing active system

#### Technical Features
- ✅ **Containerized**: Runs in Docker for easy deployment
- ✅ **Production-ready**: Gunicorn with 8 workers
- ✅ **RESTful API**: All metrics accessible via JSON
- ✅ **Health checks**: Automated container monitoring
- ✅ **Workload simulator**: Creates realistic activity for demonstrations

### 5. Demo Flow

#### A. Show the Dashboard (1 minute)
- Point out the three main metrics: CPU, Memory, Disk
- Show the real-time charts updating
- Highlight the color-coded status (green = normal)

#### B. Explain the Architecture (2 minutes)
- Flask application monitoring the container
- Background workload simulator creating activity
- RESTful API for programmatic access
- Docker deployment for portability

#### C. Show the API (1 minute)
Open terminal and run:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5001/api/metrics/all | jq .
```

Show JSON response with:
- CPU metrics (percent, per-core, frequency)
- Memory metrics (virtual, swap)
- Disk metrics (partitions, I/O stats)
- Alert levels (normal/warning/critical)

#### D. Show Live Fluctuations (1 minute)
```bash
# Run this in terminal
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "Sample $i:"
  curl -s http://localhost:5001/api/metrics/all | jq '{CPU: .cpu.percent, Memory: .memory.virtual.percent}'
  sleep 3
done
```

Point out: "Notice how values change each time!"

#### E. Explain Technical Implementation (2 minutes)
- Python/Flask backend
- psutil for system metrics
- Chart.js for visualizations
- Docker for deployment
- Gunicorn for production serving

### 6. Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Is this monitoring the host or container?**
A: The container. That's why we added a workload simulator - containers are very lightweight.

**Q: Can it monitor multiple servers?**
A: Currently single-server, but architecture supports multi-server expansion (future enhancement).

**Q: What alerts can it send?**
A: Currently visual alerts on dashboard. Email/SMS notifications are planned enhancements.

**Q: How does it compare to Prometheus/Grafana?**
A: This is a lightweight, educational implementation. Production systems would use enterprise tools, but this demonstrates the core concepts.

**Q: Can I deploy this for real use?**
A: Yes! It's production-ready with Docker, health checks, and proper error handling.

### 7. Impressive Statistics to Mention

- ✅ **Response time**: < 500ms for health checks
- ✅ **Auto-refresh**: Every 5 seconds
- ✅ **Worker processes**: 8 Gunicorn workers for concurrency
- ✅ **Container health**: Automated monitoring every 30 seconds
- ✅ **Resource limits**: CPU: 1 core, Memory: 512MB
- ✅ **API endpoints**: 7 different endpoints
- ✅ **Code quality**: Error handling, logging, security hardening

### 8. Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps --filter name=sysinsight

# View logs
docker logs sysinsight -f

# Check processes inside container
docker exec sysinsight ps aux

# Test API
curl http://localhost:5001/health
curl http://localhost:5001/api/metrics/cpu
curl http://localhost:5001/api/metrics/memory
curl http://localhost:5001/api/metrics/disk
curl http://localhost:5001/api/metrics/all

# Stop container
docker-compose down

# Restart container
docker-compose restart

# Rebuild if you make changes
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 9. Backup Demo (If Dashboard Fails)

If browser issues occur, use terminal:
```bash
# Show live monitoring in terminal
watch -n 2 'curl -s http://localhost:5001/api/metrics/all | jq "{CPU: .cpu.percent, Memory: .memory.virtual.percent, Disk_IO: .disk.io_stats.write_mb}"'
```

### 10. Closing Points

- Built from scratch using modern tools
- Demonstrates full-stack development skills
- Production-ready with proper DevOps practices
- Real-world applicable for infrastructure monitoring
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements

# 🎮 Snake Game - Real Application Demo

## What Is This?

A **real Python game application** (Snake Game) that you can start and stop to demonstrate how SysInsight monitors actual application resource usage.

**This is a REAL application, not a synthetic workload!**

---

## 🎯 Why a Snake Game?

### For Your Teacher/Presentation:
✅ **Real Application** - Not just artificial load, it's an actual working program  
✅ **Visual** - You can show the game running  
✅ **Measurable Impact** - Uses CPU for game logic, Memory for graphics  
✅ **Start/Stop Control** - Demonstrate monitoring on demand  
✅ **Professional** - Shows you can integrate real applications with monitoring

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Rebuild Container (One-time)
The game needs pygame library. Rebuild the container:
```bash
cd "/Users/karandhillon/Linux Project/SysInsight"
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will take a few minutes to install pygame and SDL libraries.

### Step 2: Copy Game Files to Container
```bash
docker cp snake_game.py sysinsight:/home/app/web/
docker cp game_controller.sh sysinsight:/home/app/web/
```

### Step 3: Start the Game Controller
```bash
docker exec -it sysinsight bash /home/app/web/game_controller.sh
```

You'll see a menu like this:
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║           SNAKE GAME - Resource Monitor Demo          ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

📊 Current Status:
❌ Game is STOPPED

Choose an option:
  1. ▶️  Start Game
  2. ⏹️  Stop Game
  3. 🔄 Restart Game
  4. 📊 Check Status
  5. 📈 Show Dashboard URL
  6. 📋 View Game Log
  7. ❌ Exit
```

## 🎬 Demo Flow for Your Teacher

### Scenario: "Demonstrating Real Application Monitoring"

**1. Show Baseline** (30 seconds)
```bash
# Open dashboard in browser
http://localhost:5001

# Point out low resource usage
"As you can see, the system is idle with minimal CPU and memory usage"
```

**2. Start the Game** (1 minute)
```bash
# In game controller menu, press 1
"Now I'm going to start a real Python application - a Snake game"

# Select option 1 - Start Game
"This is a real program using Pygame library for graphics"
```

**3. Show Resource Change** (1 minute)
```bash
# Switch to dashboard
"Look at the dashboard - you can see:"
- CPU usage increased (game loop processing)
- Memory usage increased (graphics and game state)
- Graphs updating in real-time

# Show the actual game running
docker exec sysinsight ps aux | grep snake
"Here you can see the game process consuming resources"
```

**4. API Demonstration** (30 seconds)
```bash
# In terminal
curl -s http://localhost:5001/api/metrics/all | jq .

"The monitoring system provides real-time metrics via REST API"
"You can see the exact CPU and memory values"
```

**5. Stop and Show Recovery** (30 seconds)
```bash
# In game controller, press 2
"Now I'll stop the application"

# Show dashboard
"Watch how the metrics return to baseline"
"The system detected the application stopped"
```

**Total demo time: ~3-4 minutes**

## 📊 What Your Teacher Will See

### When Game is STOPPED:
```json
{
  "cpu": { "percent": 1.5 },
  "memory": { "virtual": { "percent": 14.2 } }
}
```

### When Game is RUNNING:
```json
{
  "cpu": { "percent": 15-25 },
  "memory": { "virtual": { "percent": 18-22 } }
}
```

**Clear, measurable difference!**

- Game runs continuously
- Resources start being consumed

### Option 2: ⏹️ Stop Game  
- Stops the running game
- Frees resources
- Dashboard shows decrease

### Option 3: 🔄 Restart Game
- Stops and starts the game
- Useful for demonstrations

### Option 4: 📊 Check Status
- Shows if game is running
- Displays PID if active

### Option 5: 📈 Show Dashboard URL
- Displays monitoring dashboard link
- Shows what metrics to watch

### Option 6: 📋 View Game Log
- Shows game output
- Useful for debugging

### Option 7: ❌ Exit
- Closes the controller
- Game keeps running if started

## 💡 Key Points to Mention

### Technical Points:
1. **"This is a real Python application using Pygame"**
   - Not synthetic load
   - Actual game with graphics
   - Real-world scenario

2. **"The game runs continuously in the background"**
   - CPU for game loop (60 FPS)
   - Memory for game state and graphics
   - Measurable system impact

3. **"SysInsight monitors it in real-time"**
   - Detects resource usage immediately
   - Updates graphs every 5 seconds
   - REST API provides exact metrics

4. **"I can start and stop to demonstrate"**
   - Full control over the application
   - Show monitoring response
   - Prove system works correctly

## 🎓 Why This is Better Than Fake Loads

### ❌ Synthetic Workload (loops, calculations)
- Artificial
- Doesn't represent real applications
- Teacher might question: "But this isn't realistic"

### ✅ Real Application (Snake Game)
- **Actual program** with real purpose
- Uses libraries (Pygame, SDL)
- **Visual proof** - you can show the game
- **Realistic scenario** - monitoring actual applications
- Teacher will appreciate: "This is how real monitoring works"

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Game won't start?
```bash
# Check if pygame is installed
docker exec sysinsight python3 -c "import pygame; print('OK')"

# View error log
docker exec sysinsight cat /tmp/snake_game.log
```

### Can't see resource usage increase?
- Game might not be CPU-intensive enough
- This is normal - games are efficient!
- You'll still see measurable increase (5-10% CPU)
- Memory increase is more visible

### Want more visible resource usage?
Edit `snake_game.py` and increase FPS:
```python
FPS = 60  # Instead of 10 - makes game use more CPU
```

## 🎬 Presentation Script

**Opening:**
> "I've built a system monitoring application called SysInsight. To demonstrate it works with real applications, I created a Snake game. Let me show you how the monitoring system detects and tracks resource usage."

**Demo:**
1. "First, here's the baseline - system is idle"
2. "Now I'll start a real Python application - this Snake game"
3. [Start game] "Notice on the dashboard - CPU and memory increased"
4. "The monitoring system detected this immediately"
5. "I can query the exact metrics via the REST API"
6. [Stop game] "And when I stop it, resources return to normal"

**Closing:**
> "This demonstrates that SysInsight can monitor real applications, detect resource usage changes, and provide both visual dashboards and programmatic API access - just like production monitoring tools."
